TO LAUNCH YOU NEED TO ENTER THE VIRTUAL ENV.
source tourpedia_env/bin/activate
jupyter notebook
Select the notebook and change the kernel to tourpedia_env from the kernel menu.

The folder with the python virtual environment "tourpedia_env-original" is not uploaded to github because it's 2GB in size, but there's nothing special about it - just Pandas and Tensorflow installed. This notebook was written on a Desktop computer because it's a compute intensive task.
